`database_interface`

The database interface is helpful to interact with larger numbers
of PF objects in the database (getting, setting, storing or comparing
attributes).
One use case is for example to define a set of standard parameters for a
larger model. Using the interface, one can easily get, store (e.g. in a json file) and later reset a set of parameters.

ToDo: Add tutorial for this interface (when there is more functionality).
